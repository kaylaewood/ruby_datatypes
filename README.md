# Ruby Data Type Exercises

This is a collection of exercises created by Turing School of Software & Design to practice various data types in Ruby.

## Setup
1. `clone` this repo.
2. `cd` into this directory.
3. Run `bundle`.
4. To run tests, `cd` into the appropriate directory (i.e. `strings`) and run `ruby [file name]` (i.e. `strings.rb`).

## Data Types:
  * Strings 
  * Integers & Floats
  * Collections & Arrays 
  
## Methods I Learned/Used:
| method | data types | explanation | JS Equivalent? |
|---|---|---|---|
|   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |
